Hi William,

Two years ago, the Init.ai team embarked on a mission to enable companies to better converse with their customers and people to more simply interact with computers. Since then, we have had the pleasure of seeing thousands of companies and developers use our solutions to create applications of every type.

Today is an exciting day for our team. Init.ai is joining a project that touches the lives of countless people across the world. We are thrilled and excited at the new opportunities this brings us to make an impact on the technological landscape.

What does this mean for you?

Due to this recent transaction, Init.ai will discontinue its service effective later this year. While we wish to make this transition as smooth as possible, we unfortunately cannot continue to operate Init.ai going forward.

If you have applications you need to keep running, you must take action to transition off of our platform. If you do not have applications you wish to migrate, no action is required.

Essential information and dates

All Init.ai applications will cease to function and the platform will be turned off on December 16.
New application creation and new user signup will be disabled immediately. In addition, existing applications will no longer be trainable, so language models are now in a "frozen" state.
If you would like a copy of your application logs or training data, please contact us for assistance with export.
Thank you

We would like to thank our users, customers, investors, Techstars, advisers, friends, and family for all of the support, feedback, and encouragement you have given us! Thank you!

â€“ The Init.ai team
