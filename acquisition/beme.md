Thank you.

To our Panels community,

As you may have heard already, Beme is undergoing major changes and as a result, weâ€™re sorry to say weâ€™ll be shutting Panels down next week.

We canâ€™t thank you enough for signing up to be part of our experiment sharing your personal stories and opinions around whatâ€™s happening in the world. The Beme YouTube channel will continue to operate with many of the same faces youâ€™ve grown to love, but the tech team is moving on to new adventures elsewhere.
