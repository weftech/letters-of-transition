We are very sad to report that Atlas Informatics is shutting down. Users who wish to finish their last searches should do so before Wednesday, October 25, 2017. To ensure your privacy, all system data will be electronically shredded on Thursday, October 26, 2017. Although your Atlas index will not be available, your files, websites, email and chats on your personal hard drives or cloud accounts will not be impacted by the shutdown - it will just be harder to find them. :(

Atlas was born to solve the growing pain of digital chaos that we all feel in our lives. We joined the fight because we saw information overload as a righteous cause, but we faced the ever-present challenge of fundraising. With the small amount of money remaining, the company has elected to make an orderly shutdown of the business to ensure employees and user data were treated fairly.

Our biggest and deepest thank you to all of the employees, customers, friends and family that have sacrificed their time to the dream of a searchable photographic memory. Research shows that we lose 20 percent of our workweek simply searching for the stuff we have already seen because all of our data is scattered across dozens of digital silos. Simply, there is no way to find, organize and share all of our own digital stuff. After thousands of user studies we are certain the problem needs to be solved, but we will have to wait for someone else to do it. When that day comes, we will be the first ones to use it! Adieu.
