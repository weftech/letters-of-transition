All good things must come to an end
We have some sad news to share today. With a heavy heart, we've decided to shut down the codebender.cc website. 

In a nutshell, we've been unable to create a sustainable business model around codebender.cc, and we simply can't afford to pick up the tab for running the site out of our own pockets anymore (did you know it costs $25K/month to provide our service?).

We'd like to thank you all for your support. You can find more info as well as our transition plan on our [Next Chapter](https://via.intercom-mail.com/e?ob=8Td1iYEJ6bR3ZWL1jbF0UmO3BEA5nguvpKQJmRYhhcqGMpWNCYldO6pr1xBPdfk4&h=424f226ae2015d6f2fcd3a49966c3f5ed1aa9f39-6408105698) page.

We've also started a conversation on that page and we would like you to be part of it, especially if you have questions for next steps, how to transition your work, etc.

codebender's next chapter
We will still be there, but we're changing our focus from the Maker market to B2B deals with enterprises interested in Cloud IDEs.
